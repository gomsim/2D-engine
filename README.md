# 2D-engine

I wanted to create a simple 3D engine, but struggled with the mathematics. Then I figured, if I took it down to two dimensions it would
reveal itself. So I made this little program.

It's a "2D engine" which lets the user draw shapes, which upon letting go of the mouse become artifacts, that can be moved, rotated
and scaled. The program also allowes zooming and selecting several shapes to interact with, and that's it.

The program was also a small excersise in separating graphics from logic.
